## Development Setup

Please see [this centralized guide](https://github.com/sidestream-tech/guides/blob/main/frontend-development/README.md) to get started with your development setup. Namely, you should:
- have a minimum `node` and `npm` version (see `package.json` `engine` section)
- have a certain formatting and linting setup

Help on both things is given in the linked resources above.
