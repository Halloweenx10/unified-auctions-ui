            that defines how a cryptocurrency called DAI is kept approximately equal to USD by incentivizing market
            players. People who help to keep DAI stable, benefit from their actions by acquiring cryptocurrency at a
            discount. The main promise of the protocol is to provide a decentralized stable currency, which can be used
            to borrow money over a longer period without being affected by unpredictable exchange rates.

            To get DAI, people need to lock up some other cryptocurrency (e.g., ETH) in a vault. With time, if the
            price of the cryptocurrency in the vault drops below the predefined ratio (e.g. 150% for ETH), owners of
            the vault have to add more collateral or return their DAI. If they fail to do so, their vault can be
            liquidated by the Maker protocol and other people can buy it at a discount.

                Your participation can yield a profit by leveraging price differences between the auction price from
                Maker Protocol and the price on other marketplaces. Similar to a Dutch-style auction system, the
                auction price starts above the real market price and drops by a defined ratio in defined time
                intervals. For example, ETH-A auctions start 30% above the market price and drop by
                <format-percentage :value="params.cut" /> every {{ params.step }} seconds. When the auction price drops
                below the exchange rate on other marketplaces there is a chance to make a profit.

            This situation exists in the first place, because the Maker protocol can not be executed by itself. There
            need to be players who execute vital parts of the protocol and pay a transaction fee for it. In a
            decentralised system like this, anyone can become such a player. But as execution can sometimes end up in a
            loss of transaction fee, those operations are made to be profitable by the protocol itself. Players who
            risk to make DAI more stable and keep the protocol in a healthy condition get rewarded with higher profits.
            Most of the auctions will be cleared by players with bots bidding very quickly, whenever there is a slight
            market opportunity. However, in some occasions like bigger market crashes a larger number of auctions will
            be started. Thatâ€™s when regular users and newcomers can have an opportunity to engage, as there can be not
            enough market players to clear all of them.
