## Maker Dao DAI

Dai (or DAI) is a stablecoin cryptocurrency which aims to keep its value as close to one United States dollar (USD) as possible through an automated system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is maintained and regulated by MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) composed of the owners of its governance token, MKR, who may vote on changes to certain parameters in its smart contracts in order to ensure the stability of Dai.

## Liquidation

In the context of the Maker protocol, a liquidation is the automatic transfer of collateral from an insufficiently collateralized Vault, along with the transfer of that Vaultâ€™s debt to the protocol. In the liquidation contract (the Dog), an auction is started promptly to sell the transferred collateral for DAI in an attempt to cancel out the debt now assigned to the protocol.
